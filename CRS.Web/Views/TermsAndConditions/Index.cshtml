TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE ISSUANCE AND USE OF RCBC BANKARD CREDIT CARDS

1. DEFINITIONS. As used herein, the words, “I”, “me”, and “my” shall refer to the principal cardholder whose name is embossed on the card, while the words “you” and “yours” shall refer to RCBC and/or Bankard. “RCBC” is Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, issuer of the CARDS; and “BANKARD” is Bankard Inc., the entity servicing the credit card business of RCBC and implementing all actions pertaining to the RCBC CARDS for and on behalf of RCBC. The word “CARD/S” refers to RCBC Bankard MasterCard, RCBC Bankard VISA, RCBC Bankard JCB, and RCBC Bankard China UnionPay (CUP) issued by RCBC through Bankard in the cardholders’ and all other extension cardholders’ name.

2. THE CARD. The CARD remains your property and is not transferable. I shall surrender the CARD to you upon demand.

3. VALIDITY. Subject to your existing policies, rules and regulations, the CARD will be honored by affiliated merchants or merchants where the MasterCard, VISA, JCB and/or CUP logos are accepted upon my due presentation while I am a Cardholder in good standing. I am in good standing if all my accounts are current, I have not exceeded my credit limit, and my credit card privileges are not otherwise suspended, canceled, or terminated, or have not expired. You shall have the option to reinstate my credit card privileges.

4. CREDIT LIMIT. You shall have the sole discretion to determine the amount of my credit limit. I will be given a credit limit expressed in either Philippine Pesos (local currency) or U.S. Dollars as approved by you, inclusive of cash advance limit, which will be my maximum allowable outstanding balance at any time. My credit limit will be shared by all my supplementary cardholder/s. I must not exceed my credit limit; otherwise, all subsequent usages shall be declined or rejected. In case I am issued more than one card by you, I will abide by the condition that I may, at your sole discretion, be given a separate credit limit for each of the credit cards I avail myself of, or a consolidated credit limit for all cards, expressed in either Philippine Peso or U.S. Dollar as deemed applicable by you. I may request for an increase or decrease in credit limit subject to your approval.

5. MERCHANT ACCEPTANCE. The CARD is accepted worldwide by accredited establishments contracted to accept the CARD or where the MasterCard, VISA, JCB and/or CUP logos are honored. I shall hold you free and harmless from any liability if (1) the CARD is not honored by any merchant for any reason beyond your control such as but not limited to the merchants’ refusal of cardholders who are suspected of being fraudulent and/or (2) you refuse, at your option, to grant credit authorization for any purchase notwithstanding the availability of credit in my favor under my CARD Account for any reason such as but not limited to prevention of fraud activities. Furthermore, I will not hold you liable for any defective product or service purchased through the CARD. Any dispute between me and the merchant shall not relieve me of my obligation to pay all charges arising from the use of the CARD.

6. RCBC BANKARD INSTALLMENT. I may avail myself of RCBC Bankard’s Installment Program to purchase items/goods from designated RCBC Bankard Installment merchants if the card issued to me allows such installment transactions. I agree to pay the monthly installment until the account is fully paid using the repayment period I choose. My credit limit will be reduced by the amount of such purchases.

I shall be informed of the amount of the monthly installments thru the sales slip that I sign or through my Statement of Account. The monthly installment will become part of my Outstanding Balance on which the minimum amount due is based. My monthly installment is computed in such a way that, after applying the payment to interest due for the billing period and whatever remains of the payment towards principal, for the number of months I chose, my purchase is totally paid.

The interest rate charged on RCBC Bankard’s Installment transactions may be different from the one used to compute interest charged when I pay the minimum amount due on my regular non-installment card usage. If I do not pay in full my billed outstanding balance which includes both regular and installment balances, my monthly installment will be charged interest.

If I wish to prepay any of my installment purchases, I will inform you and you shall then bill the remaining balance in my next statement. A pre-termination fee representing a certain percentage of the unpaid principal amount or five hundred pesos, whichever is higher, will also be charged to me in my next statement.

If applicable, in addition to using my CARD to purchase from RCBC Bankard installment merchants, you may also grant my request to convert a part of my non-installment outstanding balance to an installment transaction, provided I am in good credit standing. Such balances converted will be treated like a usual installment transaction from the date that you grant such request.

7. STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT. A monthly Statement of Account (SOA) will be given to me showing my Statement Date, Outstanding Balance as of Statement Date, Payment Due Date and minimum amount due under RCBC Bankard’s installment payment arrangement.

If I am issued a Dollar card, all my purchases in currencies not in U.S. Dollar shall be converted to U.S. Dollar; if I am issued a Peso card, all my purchases in currencies other than Pesos shall be converted to Philippine Peso. The SOA shall be in its applicable currency.

In case I do not receive said SOA, I shall immediately inform you thereof. In the absence of any report of non-receipt of the SOA, I am deemed to have received the same. The absence of the SOA or my failure to receive the same shall not relieve me from paying all charges arising from the use of the CARD on due date. The SOA shall form an integral part of this Agreement.

In the event of any error in the SOA, I hereby agree to notify you immediately of said error. If no error is reported within thirty (30) days from my Statement Date, I agree and confirm that you can conclusively consider the SOA as true and correct. I hereby waive the presentation of the charge/sales slips to prove the transactions/availments in the Statement of Account.

8. PAYMENT OF CARD AVAILMENTS AND CHARGES. The Minimum Amount Due is either (a) the total outstanding balance within my credit limit multiplied by the required payment percentage determined by you plus the entire excess over the credit limit, all past due amounts and late payment penalty fees, if any, or (b) Php500 for Peso card or USD15 for Dollar card, whichever is higher.

I understand that checks used for payment will be credited to my account only upon collection as per usual transit/clearing schedules for local and outstation credits, net of charges from the drawee bank and your own charges.

In case I am issued two or more cards by you, I hereby authorize you without any obligation on your part, to unilaterally apply, without notice to me, payments made by me, or amounts from overpayments to any of my accounts at your option and sole discretion.

All amounts remaining unpaid after the Payment Due Date will form part of the minimum amount due and will be considered delinquent. I will then be liable to pay penalty, interest and other charges as applicable. You reserve the right to demand the payment of the obligation in full including all unbilled transactions, in case of default.

These terms and conditions shall remain in full force and effect until full and final payment of my total outstanding obligation with you.
9. INTEREST. Every Payment Due Date of each billing cycle, I have the option to pay the Total Outstanding Balance in full or the minimum amount due as indicated in my Statement of Account, or any amount in between. No interest will be imposed if I pay in full. Interest will be charged if my payment by the Payment Due Date is less than the Total Balance Due, if no payment is made to the CARD by Payment Due Date, or if a Cash Advance transaction has been made. The interest will be imposed at the current interest rate on the (a) unpaid Cash Advance balance (including interest charges and fees) from acquisition date until both the Cash Advance balance and its related charges are paid in full; and (b) unpaid balance (inclusive of interest charges and fees) stated in the previous Statement of Account and on all new transactions incurred within the previous statement period computed from the transaction date until the current statement date.

10. INTEREST COMPUTATION. Interest is computed as follows: For Retail transactions: (1) Multiply the applicable monthly interest rate to Retail Transactions, installment amortizations, any retails fees and non-interest charges for the day and divide it by 30. The interest on Retail transactions and installment amortizations in the current statement date will not be included until the next statement date. (2) Multiply the applicable monthly interest rate to previous day’s retail outstanding balance and deduct any payments made during the same day, following the application of payments, and divide it by 30. The interest computed in (1) and (2) will be the total interest for the day on Retail transactions and outstanding balance. The new retail outstanding balance will be the previous statement balance plus retail transactions, installment amortizations, retail fees and non-interest charges less payment. The retail interest for the month is the sum of the interest for each day from the day after the previous statement date to the current statement date . Interest charged on retail transactions and instalment amortization will be added to the retail outstanding balance in the next statement date while interest charged on the retail fees and non-interest charges will be added to the retail outstanding balance in the current statement date. For Cash Advance transaction: (1) Multiply the applicable monthly interest rate to Cash Advance availments and its related non-interest fees and charges for the day and divide it by 30. (2) Multiply the applicable monthly interest rate to previous day’s cash advance outstanding balance and deduct any payments made during the same day, following the application of payments, and divide it by 30. The interest computed in steps 1 and 2 will be the total interest for the day on cash advance. The cash advance outstanding balance will be the previous statement balance plus cash availments and its related non-interest fees and charges less payment. Interest charged on Cash Advances will be added to the Cash Advance outstanding balance in the current statement date. The process is repeated until the nest statement date.

11. MONTHLY INSTALLMENT DUE. The Monthly Installment Due forms part of the Minimum Amount Due in the Statement of Account. If I choose to pay only a portion of the Total Balance Due as indicated on the Statement of Account, the unpaid portion of the Installment Due shall be subject to the monthly interest charge at the prevailing rate. Usual monthly late charge applies. The computation of the Monthly Installment Due shall be on a diminishing balance basis under which the allocation of payment to the principal and the interest of the Monthly Installment Due over the term (number of months) is not equal.

12. LATE PAYMENT FEES. The past due balance indicated in the SOA shall be charged with late payment fee for every month of delay. A fraction of a month shall be considered one month. Late payment charges due and unpaid shall form part of the principal balance and shall continue to be assessed and be charged with interest per month until my account is fully paid. Provided it is within reasonable time and with prior notice to me, you shall have the right to change the rate of the late payment fee.

13. MEMBERSHIP FEES. I will be charged Membership Fee in the amount to be determined by you for the use of the Card and/or the other facilities and services which may from time to time be made available to me and/or for the maintenance and administration of any balance or transaction on the Card. I agree to pay said fee, which may be charged to the credit line or on any available fund on the Card account. All fees paid are nonrefundable.
14. OTHER FEES. I agree to pay such other fees relating but not limited to the processing of cash advance and/or payments that may be imposed by you at your option. I understand that amount of said fees may be revised from time to time as you may deem necessary.

15. CHANGES IN FEES AND CHARGES. You reserve the right to change, at any time and from time to time, the amount, rates, types and/or basis of calculation of all interest, fees and charges payable by me; provided, however, that the changes shall become effective thirty (30) days from notice to me. The notice of changes of interest, fees and charges may be contained in the Statement of Account. You may charge the new rates to the Card account and/or request that I pay the same on demand.

16. TAXES. I agree to pay whatever taxes may be imposed on my CARD transactions, fees and charges, based on existing as well as future regulations.

17. LIABILITY OF THE CARDHOLDER. I shall be liable to you for amounts charged to my CARD, including the finance charges or interest, all nonrefundable fees, full annual membership fees and other charges whether made in the Philippines or abroad. For ATM Cash Advance transactions, any use of the CARD together with the Cash Advance PIN to obtain cash in any authorized ATM constitutes my agreement to the Terms and Conditions governing the issuance and use of the CARDS’ Cash Advance Facility. I understand that additional service fee from Cash Advance availed of is charged to my account. I agree that all cash advances shall be conclusively presumed to have been personally made by me.

18. FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS. All charges and transactions made in currencies other than Philippine Peso shall, in accordance with your procedures, be automatically converted to Philippine Peso at an exchange rate determined by MasterCard/Visa/JCB/China UnionPay which amount represents my payment to you for the purchase and payment of the foreign currency necessary to discharge the amounts due to foreign merchants. The exchange rate applied is determined on the date of posting to my Card account and may be different from the rate in effect on the date the transaction is made. The converted amount shall be charged by up to 2.03% representing the Bank’s service fee and any assessment fee(s) charged by MasterCard/Visa/JCB/China UnionPay.

The order confirmation for mail order/telephone order and Internet transactions or the delivery form/receipt or the sales/charge slips which I sign each and every time a purchase is made through the use of the CARD shall constitute and be considered and construed by you as the written Application required by CB Circular No.1389 to enable me to purchase the foreign exchange necessary for all my non-trade transactions using the CARD.

19. SUPPLEMENTARY CARDS. If a supplementary card is issued upon my request, I shall be liable for all the charges made on the said card including interest and non-refundable fees as other charges which shall be fully paid. Should I request for the cancellation of my supplementary card, I agree and bind myself to pay and be liable for purchases made through the card even after the request for cancellation thereof and until such time that said Card shall have been actually surrendered by me to you thus preventing its effective use.

20. EXPIRY AND RENEWAL OF THE CARD. Unless either terminated or cancelled, the CARD shall be valid up to the last day of the month indicated thereon. The renewal of the CARD shall be at your sole discretion. If my CARD is not renewed, the whole obligation becomes immediately due and demandable.

21. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION. You may suspend, revoke or terminate my right to use the CARD in the Philippines and abroad at any time with or without cause and without need of prior notice. If, for any reason, my right to use the CARD is revoked, all my privileges shall be terminated and my entire obligation including all unbilled balance shall become due and demandable. I shall hold you free and harmless from any loss or damage arising from the revocation or termination of the CARD, its use and privileges. Continued use of my CARD in case of suspension, termination or non-issuance of renewal CARDS shall be deemed as fraudulent. I understand that if my CARD is suspended or cancelled, I shall continue to pay annual membership fees until my total outstanding obligation is fully paid.

(For YGC Employees) I further understand and agree that all CARD/S issued under my name or any of my extension cardholders by reason of my being a YGC employee shall be cancelled upon my separation from employment without need of prior notice. Upon cancellation, all outstanding balance on my CARD/S shall become immediately due and demandable. I hereby authorize BANKARD INC. and my YGC employer to deduct against any salary, commissions, bonuses, allowances, compensation or separation benefits due to me from my YGC employer, if any, such amount to settle and pay all my outstanding balance on the CARD/S issued to me. I hereby hold BANKARD, INC. and my YGC employer free and harmless from any claim for damage in implementing this authority. My continued use of the CARD/S expresses my agreement to the foregoing provisions and the other terms and conditions for the issuance and use of the CARDS.
